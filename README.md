# 🛰️ Optimizing Distributed Tracing and Telemetry in Microservices Using OpenTelemetry

## 📌 Overview

This project explores how to optimize observability in microservices by leveraging **OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing and telemetry. The goal is to improve trace collection, metric granularity, and system performance in a scalable microservices architecture.

---

## 🚀 Milestone 1: Foundation Setup & Basic Observability Integration

### 🎯 Objective

- Build a minimal microservices architecture.
- Integrate OpenTelemetry for collecting traces and metrics.
- Validate the observability pipeline end-to-end.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Node.js / Python / Java (choose based on your repo)
- **Microservices**: Dockerized services (e.g., `user-service`, `order-service`)
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry SDK, Collector
- **Visualization**: Jaeger (for Tracing), Prometheus & Grafana (for Metrics)
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes / Docker Compose
- **Platform**: Minikube / AWS EC2 (if cloud)
