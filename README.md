# 🛰️ Optimizing Distributed Tracing and Telemetry in Microservices Using OpenTelemetry

## 📌 Overview

This project explores how to optimize observability in microservices by leveraging **OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing and telemetry. The goal is to improve trace collection, metric granularity, and system performance in a scalable microservices architecture.

---

## 🚀 Milestone 1: Foundation Setup & Basic Observability Integration

### 🎯 Objective

- Build a minimal microservices architecture.
- Integrate OpenTelemetry for collecting traces and metrics.
- Validate the observability pipeline end-to-end.

---
## 🚀 Milestone 2: Advanced Tracing Configuration

- Implement W3C Trace Context propagation between microservices.
- Use middleware/interceptor (e.g., OpenTelemetry Instrumentation Libraries).
- Visualize end-to-end trace in Jaeger.
- Demonstrate span hierarchy (parent-child relationship).

## 🚀 Milestone 3: Metrics Enhancement & Custom Metrics

- Add custom metrics (e.g., order_processed, user_registered).
- Instrument metrics using OpenTelemetry API.
- Configure Prometheus scraping targets.
- Create Grafana dashboards for custom KPIs (latency, request volume, errors, etc.).

## 🚀 Milestone 4: Logging Integration and Correlation

- Integrate logging (e.g., with Winston, Log4j, or Python’s logging) + OpenTelemetry context.
- Inject trace_id and span_id into logs.
- Export logs to backend (e.g., Loki, Elasticsearch).
- Correlate trace → log → metric via trace_id.

## 🚀 Milestone 5: Performance Optimization

- Evaluate impact of telemetry on CPU, memory, and network.
- Batch vs immediate export comparison.
- Enable sampling strategies (e.g., always-on, probabilistic, rate-limited).
- Implement AlwaysOnSampler → TraceIdRatioBasedSampler.
- Visualize the effect using system performance dashboards.

## 🚀 Milestone 6: Deploy in Kubernetes

- Deploy services on Minikube / Kubernetes cluster.

- Use Helm charts for:

    - OpenTelemetry Collector

    - Prometheus

    - Grafana

    - Jaeger

- Configure OTLP exporters and service discovery.
  
## 🚀 Milestone 7: Real-World Scenario Demo & Final Evaluation


- Trace a typical business transaction (e.g., user registration → order → payment).

- Present:

  Full trace

  Custom metric dashboard

  Logs with trace correlation

- Evaluate observability goals: latency reduction, error identification, system insight.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Node.js / Python / Java (choose based on your repo)
- **Microservices**: Dockerized services (e.g., `user-service`, `order-service`)
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry SDK, Collector
- **Visualization**: Jaeger (for Tracing), Prometheus & Grafana (for Metrics)
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes / Docker Compose
- **Platform**: Minikube / AWS EC2 (if cloud)
